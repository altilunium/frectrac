# frectrac
Frectrac is an application for tracking recurring events and analyzing their timing patterns. It is designed for observational use cases such as recording any repeated real-world occurrence.

Many recurring events follow subtle patterns over time. Frectrac helps you answer questions such as:

* How long is the interval between the two most recent occurrences?
* What is the average duration between events?
* If we ignore dates and compress all events into a 24-hour frame, at what time do they usually happen?
* Do events tend to cluster in the morning, afternoon, evening, or late at night?

The goal is observational pattern discovery based on recorded timestamps.
